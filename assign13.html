		<h1>The History of The Legend of Zelda</h1>
		<h2>The Creation of the World</h2>
			<p>Before time began, there was only a formless void known as the Still World, where Null would devour anything that tried to form. The three Golden Goddesses descended upon the chaos. Din, the Goddess of Power, created the land. Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom, bestowed order upon the world. Farore, the Goddess of Courage, created life. As a result of their efforts, Null was imprisoned. However Null attempted to create Rifts that would devour the world and return it to the void, so the goddesses created the Tris to mend the Rifts. Their labor complete, the goddesses departed for the heavens. Before they left the world they created, the three goddesses created and left behind the Triforce entrusting it with the goddess Hylia. The Triforce is an all-powerful artifact which would grant its holder their heart's desire.</p>
		
		<h2>The Era of Hylia and the Ancient Battle</h2>
			<p>The Triforce was entrusted to the goddess Hylia during the Era of Hylia, known more fully as the Era of the Goddess Hylia. One day, the Demon King Demise sought to take it and make the world his own. He raised an army of malevolent forces against Hyrule. Hylia gathered the surviving humans on an outcrop of earth and sent it to The Sky beyond a Cloud Barrier of her creation. The outcrop would later become known as Skyloft. She hid the Triforce there as well. Hylia rallied the Surface tribes of the Gorons, Kikwi, Mogma, Parella and the Ancient Robots, to fight back the evil forces led by Demise, and sealed them away. She suffered grave injuries in the battle. Knowing the seal on Demise would not hold, she devised a plan. As the Triforce could not be wielded by a god, Hylia renounced divinity and transferred her soul to the body of a mortal who would come of age when Demise returned. She created the Goddess Sword and the spirit Fi to aid her chosen hero, who would reveal himself when he drew the sword from its pedestal. After thousands of years, the surface world was forgotten by the humans above...</p>
			
		<h2>Sky Era</h2>
			<p>Thousands of years later, during the Sky Era, Hylia is reborn as Zelda in Skyloft. On the day of the 25th annual Wing Ceremony, she is taken down to the Surface in a tornado created by Ghirahim, who attempts to have her kidnapped to revive his master Demise. Zelda is rescued from his minions by Impa, whom Hylia had sent through time to help her mortal self.
			Zelda regains her memories as Hylia. Her childhood friend, Link, is led by Fi to draw the Goddess Sword, and so is revealed to be Hylia's chosen hero. At the Temple of Time, Zelda and Impa flee from Ghirahim by going through the Gate of Time and destroying it behind them. Link seeks out the three Sacred Flames to temper his sword into the Master Sword, which he uses to activate the second Gate of Time at the Sealed Temple. He finds Zelda by using the Gate of Time to travel back to the Era of Hylia, to a time shortly after when Demise was sealed. Zelda places herself in a thousand-year slumber to sustain the seal.
			Link returns to the present, gathers the Triforce, and uses it to destroy Demise. Zelda awakens from her agelong slumber only to be kidnapped by Ghirahim. Ghirahim takes her to the past, where Demise is still alive, and uses her soul to revive his master. Link defeats Demise in battle and the Demon King is permanently sealed away in the Master Sword. With his last words, Demise vows an incarnation of his hatred (Ganon) shall ever follow "those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit of the hero" in a cycle without end.
			Link thrusts the Master Sword into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple; Fi becomes forever dormant in the sword. Link and Zelda return to the present, but Impa stays in the past—in her own time—to watch over the Master Sword. Zelda and Link resolve to live on The Surface and watch over the Triforce.
			Princess Zelda (Hylia reincarnate), Link, and others from Skyloft repopulated the surface world. Their descendants became known as Hylians. During this time, the land was named Hyrule.</p>
			
		<h2>Era of Chaos and Era of Prosperity</h2>
			<p>After many years of peace in Hyrule, word spread of the supreme power of the Triforce. War engulfed the land, heralding the Era of Chaos. In particular, a group of powerful sorcerers known as the Interlopers sought dominion over the Sacred Realm, where the Triforce was located. The goddesses sent the Spirits of Light to banish them to the Twilight Realm. To protect the Triforce, the sage Rauru built a new Temple of Time at the location of the Sealed Temple, around the pedestal holding the Master Sword — the location of the only entrance to the Sacred Realm. He placed the Triforce in the Temple of Light and sealed off the Sacred Realm with him inside it in an event called Sealing the Sacred Realm. The Master Sword became the key that joined the Temple of Time to the Temple of Light. It was closed behind the Door of Time. During the Era of Prosperity, Zelda's descendants established the kingdom of Hyrule and became its Royal Family. The Oocca also participated in Hyrule's founding.
			Many members of the royal family were born with special powers given that they were blood relatives of the goddess Hylia. Princesses born into the royal family were named Zelda after the goddess reincarnate.</p>
			
		<h2>Force Era</h2>
			<p>During the Force Era, Hyrule was attacked by evil beings. The Minish, known to the Hylians as Picori, descended from the sky to save Hyrule. They brought the Picori Blade and the Light Force to the Hero of Men. The Hero sealed the evil beings in the Bound Chest and locked it with the Picori Blade. To commemorate the event, a Picori Festival was held once a year. During the festival, the champion of a sword-fighting tournament would earn the right to touch the Picori Blade.
			On the hundredth anniversary of the Picori Festival, a corrupted, power-seeking Minish named Vaati wins the sword-fighting tournament. During the award ceremony, Vaati breaks the Picori Blade and opens the Bound Chest, hoping to find the Light Force. This unleashes evil onto the Hyrule. He turns Zelda to stone and later kidnaps her when he discovers the Light Force is within her. He uses the Light Force to transform into a winged demon.
			Link, a blacksmith's apprentice and Zelda's friend, is enlisted by King Daltus to have the Picori Blade reforged so it can break the curse on Zelda. He teams up with Ezlo, a Minish sage and Vaati's former mentor—Vaati had gained his power when he stole the Mage's Cap from Ezlo. With the help of Ezlo and other Minish, Link reforges the Picori Blade and infuses it with the Four Elements to create the Four Sword. With it in hand, Link vanquishes Vaati, breaking the curse on Princess Zelda. Zelda uses the Mage's Cap to wish Hyrule back to normal.</p>
			
		<h2>Four Swords and the Era of the Hero of Time</h2>
			<p>Vaati was presumed dead, but soon reappeared. Having no memory of his previous life as a Minish, he declared himself Wind Mage and claimed the Palace of Winds. He brought terror to the land by kidnapping young maidens. A Hero appeared carrying the Four Sword. He sealed the demon inside the sword, which was then enshrined in the Four Sword Sanctuary.
			Generations later, Vaati the Wind Mage breaks free and kidnaps Princess Zelda, taking her to the Palace of Winds. Link, who witnessed the kidnapping, draws the Four Sword and is split into four Links. The Links gather three keys to Vaati's Palace from the Great Fairies in the Sea of Trees, Talus Cave, and Death Mountain. The Links defeat Vaati in his palace and rescue Princess Zelda. The Wind Mage is once again sealed in the Four Sword, which is returned to its pedestal. Link regains his original form.
			Hyrule enters a long period of civil war. During the war, a dying Hylian woman flees to the Kokiri Forest and entrusts her baby boy Link to the Great Deku Tree. The boy is raised as a Kokiri. Eventually, the King of Hyrule ends the war and unifies the kingdom. Around this time Ganondorf was born. This new evil would cause endless destruction across Hyrule over millenia.</p>
			
		<h2>Ocarina of Time</h2>
			<p>Ganondorf, leader of the Gerudo, openly swears fealty to the king, but plots to open the Door of Time to obtain the Triforce. To that end, he curses the Great Deku Tree in an attempt to wrest from him the Kokiri's Emerald. With his dying breath, the Great Deku Tree sets Link and the fairy Navi on a quest to stop Ganondorf.
			Link meets Princess Zelda, who, like Link, had premonitions of Ganondorf's treachery. The two plot to open the Door of Time and get to the Triforce before Ganondorf. When Link opens the Door of Time and draws the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time, he is sealed within the Chamber of Sages for seven years. He reawakens as the Hero of Time. In this time, Ganondorf had entered the Sacred Realm, seized the Triforce and transformed Hyrule into a world of monsters. However, the Triforce had split in three and Ganondorf retained only the Triforce of Power. Link gained the Triforce of Courage, and Princess Zelda the Triforce of Wisdom. Ganondorf had used his power to take control of Hyrule Castle, and the Sacred Realm was transformed into the Evil Realm due to his evil heart.
			Using the combined power of the Master Sword and the Seven Sages, Link and Princess Zelda seal Ganondorf in the Evil Realm after a grueling battle. Ganondorf vows to destroy Link, Zelda, and the Sages' descendants when the seal is one day broken.
			Princess Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to return Link to his own time. Link places the Master Sword back in the pedestal and closes the Door of Time. Navi, her mission complete, disappears.</p>
			
		<h2>Timeline splits into three branches</h2>
			<p>The timeline splits into three branches after Ocarina of Time. The Fallen Hero Timeline is a branch in which Ganon defeats the Hero of Time. The branch where Link defeats Ganon is itself split in two when Princess Zelda sends Link back in time to childhood. The Child Timeline is the branch that follows Link back to his own time. The Adult Timeline is the branch where the Hero of Time has disappeared from the world. Inexplicably, the Master Sword exists in both branches. In the Child Timeline, Link returns it to the Pedestal of Time. In the Adult Timeline, Zelda does it herself.</p>
